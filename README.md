## General Background
* Adolescent suicide death are the most common form of premature death in females and the second one for males.
* Adolescent suicidal attempts are relatively common (more than 5% reports attempting in the previous year)
* Major depressive disorder is major risk factors for adolescent suicidal behaviors
* Clinical evaluation remains subjective, mostly relying on expert experience
* Objective biomarkers aiding risk evaluation are needed to improve prevention

## Description of the sample and imaging data
96 participants divided in 3 groups
1) Depressed adolescents *with* suicidal attempts
2) Depressed adolescents *without* suicidal attempts
3) Healthy adolescents

## Scanning sessions:
* Resting-state (10 min)
* Cyberball Task
* Go-No-Go Task
* T1 anatomical scan (MPRAGE - adni protocol)
* Diffusion Tensor Imaging

## Objectives for the brain hack 2019:
- 1) Develop advanced visualization tools for my current structural data
- 2) Organize my data set into the BIDS format. 
- 3) Preprocessing with fMRIprep on Compute Canada
- 4) Learning the basic mechanisms of Github and contribute to a developing project (Nistat)
- 5) Implement first-level and second-level analysis of task-based fMRI with nistat

## Deliverables (contained in the current repo)

* 1) Jupyter Notebook with code to produce interactive plots of my structural data
* 2) Summary of the process of converting my data set to BIDS using dcm2bids
* 3) Batch script used on Compute Canada to run fmriprep of results
* 4) Jupyter Notebook with code for first-level analysis
* 5) Jupyter Notebook with code for second-level analysis
* 6) Summary of the process of submitting a PR on the Nistat repo
