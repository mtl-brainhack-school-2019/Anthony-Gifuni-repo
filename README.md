## General Background

* Adolescent suicide death are the most common form of premature death in females and the second one for males.
* Adolescent suicidal attempts are relatively common (more than 5% reports attempting in the previous year)
* Major depressive disorder is major risk factors for adolescent suicidal behaviors
* Clinical evaluation remains subjective, mostly relying on expert experience
* Objective biomarkers aiding risk evaluation are needed to improve prevention

## Description of the sample and imaging data
96 participants divided in 3 groups
1) Depressed adolescents *with* suicidal attempts
2) Depressed adolescents *without* suicidal attempts
3) Healthy adolescents

## Scanning sessions:
* Resting-state (10 min)
* Cyberball Task
* Go-No-Go Task
* T1 anatomical scan (MPRAGE - adni protocol)
* Diffusion Tensor Imaging

## Objectives for the brain hack 2019:

- 1) Organize my data set into the BIDS format. 
- 2) Preprocessing with fMRI prep
- 3) Analysis of fuctional connectivity using nilearn

## New tools and protocols

![BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/Whitelogo_transparent.png)

## To-do list and lingering issues 

- 1) Organize my data set into the BIDS format. 
  - [x] Apply dcm2bids to dataset
  - [x] Run bids dataset in the BIDS validator
  - [ ] Clean data set 
- 2) Preprocessing with fMRI prep
  - [ ] Run fmriprep on single user using singularity on Compute Canada
  - [ ] 
- 3) Analysis of fuctional connectivity using nilearn
