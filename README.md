## General Background

* Adolescent suicide death are the most common form of premature death in females and the second one for males.
* Adolescent suicidal attempts are relatively common (more than 5% reports attempting in the previous year)
* Major depressive disorder is major risk factors for adolescent suicidal behaviors
* Clinical evaluation remains subjective, mostly relying on expert experience
* Objective biomarkers aiding risk evaluation are needed to improve prevention

## Description of the sample and imaging data
96 participants divided in 3 groups
1) Depressed adolescents *with* suicidal attempts
2) Depressed adolescents *without* suicidal attempts
3) Healthy adolescents

## Scanning sessions:
* Resting-state (10 min)
* Cyberball Task
* Go-No-Go Task
* T1 anatomical scan (MPRAGE - adni protocol)
* Diffusion Tensor Imaging

## Objectives for the brain hack 2019:

[ ] Organize my data set into the BIDS format.
[ ] Start running fMRIprep on the sample using Compute Canada Resources.
[ ] Learn how to use nilearn and other python libraries to analyze resting-state functional connectivity.
[ ] Using python libraries to analyse task-based fMRI.
