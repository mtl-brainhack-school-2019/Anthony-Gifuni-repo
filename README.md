*Exploring the Saliency Network Connectivity in Adolescent Suicide Attempters*

## Personal Bio

Hi, my name is Anthony Gifuni. I'm a young psychiatrist, graduated from McGill University. I obtained my MD and a MSc from Universit√© de Montreal in 2012. I'm now completing my PhD in Neuroscience at McGill, set to finish this year. My interests include mood disorders and suicidal behaviors emphasizing their neural correlates in the context of adolescent brain development. I'm dedicated at translating research advances in neuroimaging to advance psychiatric clinical care and modifying positively trajectories. 

## General Background

Suicidal behaviors and thoughts are quintessential human behaviors, although some form of self-harm or extreme self-neglect resulting in death can be seen in the animal kingdom. The cognitive processes underlying suicide are complex and multilayered. Suicidal behaviors involve not only higher-cognitive processes including self-awareness, decision-making, and executive functions, but also more emotional and socio-cognitive processing. The pathophysiology of suicidal behaviors are likely not located within a single functional system, but in the integration of these systems. Suicidal thoughts and behaviors frequently have their onset in adolescence. My project aims at expanding our understanding of the neural basis of suicidal behaviors in adolescence.

Adolescence is a period of dramatic change, occuring at multiple level. The sensitivity of emotional systems are exacerbated by the hormonal surge of puberty; the social landscape of adolescents are transformed; it is the time to explore limits. Paralleling these drastic changes, the brain undergoes protracted changes in structural and functional connectivity. 

Adolescent is a period of vulnerability for affective disorders and it is characterized by increased risk-taking. The 2 major causes of mortality in youth are behavioral: car accidents and suicide. Clinically, we are often confronted with depressed teenagers struggling with suicidal ideations. Advances in neuroimaging could assist clinicians in providing objective evidence of suicidal risk. Ultimately, neuroimaging markers associated with adolescent suicidality could provide new therapeutic targets and offer new avenue for primary and secondary prevention.

## Description of the sample and imaging data
(...to be completed)
97 participants
Scanning sessions include:
* T1 anatomical scan
* Resting-state (10 min)
* Cyberball Task
* Go-No-Go Task
* Diffusion Tensor Imaging

## Objectives for the brain hack 2019:

1) Organize my data set into the BIDS format.
2) Start running fMRIprep on the sample using Compute Canada Resources.
3) Learn how to use nilearn and other python libraries to analyze resting-state functional connectivity.
4) Using python libraries to analyse task-based fMRI.
