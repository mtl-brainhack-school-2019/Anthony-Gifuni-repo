While experimenting with the Nistat package, I experimented a few bugs and notice a few typos in the explanatory code. This gave me the opportunity to create my first pull request (PR). Here is a small summary of the process involved.

1. Fork the repository containing Nistat to my own github account.

2. Clone the repository on your local machine. 
  `git clone <name-of-repo>`

3. Create a branch.

Git Clone repository on your machine
Create branch
git checkout -b <new_branch>
git pull = ERROR
git push = ERROR
 git push --set-upstream origin <new_branch>
Do your modification
git commit <modified file> -m <“message”>
git push 
Go on the original repository. Create the pull request.
